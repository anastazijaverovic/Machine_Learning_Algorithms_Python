# Machine_Learning_Algorithms_Python

Machine Learning algorithms repository coded in Python
This repository is created after the similar repository was coded in R. My goal in this project is to code the exercises on the same ML topics and datasets using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
The topics cover data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, association rule learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing (NLP) and Deep Learning algorithms, as well as dimensionality reduction and model selection, boosting and evaluation.
Enjoy!
